            1.SQL(structure query language)                         2.NoSQL(mongoDB)
            -structure format                                       - no structure format
            -no extra field can be added                            - can add new fields


moongose - provides structure to mongoDB, provides queries to create, read, update and delete DATABASE

     CRUD OPERATIONS - CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE

schema(operation) - In this we createa bleprint, that how a document will look like in a collection 

moongose.Schema({

})

to add document in collection -----
1. Usercreate({
    name:"sdfb",
    email:"knkn@gmail.com",
    age:25,
    arr:["sdf","bvb","hui"]
})

mrc structure - model(schemas and collections) , routes(path of api), controllers(logics like create user, update and others)

// moduler structure - using export to export functions, methods ad models & require to import it in files where we want to use them

why mrc structure is important ? 
        1. Gives Categorization for every models, routes so that it can be edit easily in future so that every functionality can be accessed easily
        2.
